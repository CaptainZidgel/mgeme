/*
(
None of these commands are required, but BLACKLIST, LVL2, LVL1, encompass all available commands). The default level is 1. No blank lines or comments are allowed.
For a user at level 1, they are whitelisted, and their friends are whitelisted.
For a user at level 2, they are whitelisted, and their friends are whitelisted at level 1.
Blacklisted users can't be whitelisted, and their friendslist is not checked when they are seen in another person's list (however their friends are not blacklisted).
Whitelisting does not override bans.
